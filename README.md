# Goole Cloud Platform Docker lab step
Introduction to Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. With Docker, you can separate your applications from your infrastructure and treat your infrastructure like a managed application. Docker helps you ship code faster, test faster, deploy faster, and shorten the cycle between writing code and running code.

Docker does this by combining kernel containerization features with workflows and tooling that helps you manage and deploy your applications.

Docker containers can be directly used in Kubernetes, which allows them to be run in the Kubernetes Engine with ease. After learning the essentials of Docker, you will have the skillset to start developing Kubernetes and containerized applications.

What you'll learn
In this lab, you will learn how to do the following:

  * How to build, run, and debug Docker containers.
  *  How to pull Docker images from Docker Hub and Google Artifact Registry.
  * How to push Docker images to Google Artifact Registry.
  
# Prerequisites

This is an introductory level lab. Little to no prior experience with Docker and containers is assumed. Familiarity with Cloud Shell and the command line is suggested, but not required. If you are looking for more advanced material in this service area, be sure to check out the following labs:
